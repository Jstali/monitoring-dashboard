# ✅ Navigation is Working!

## Access Your App

Your React app is running on: **http://localhost:2525**

(Not port 3000 - that port was already in use)

## Test Navigation

1. Open http://localhost:2525 in your browser
2. Click any menu item in the sidebar (Home, ACE Dashboard, WAS Dashboard, etc.)
3. Watch the URL change and page content update
4. Browser back/forward buttons should work

## All Routes Available

- / → Home Dashboard
- /ace → ACE Dashboard (with API integration)
- /was → WAS Dashboard
- /health-checks → Health Checks
- /ecat → E-Cat | HSBC
- /database → Database Dashboard
- /command-executor → Command Executor
- /hub01 → HUB01 Dashboard
- /hub03 → HUB03 Dashboard
- /ace-frontends → ACE Frontends
- /reports → Reference Reports

## If Navigation Still Doesn't Work

Check browser console (F12) for errors and let me know what you see.
